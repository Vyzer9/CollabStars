# 🎯 About
CollabStars helps GitHub users build meaningful networks, participate in projects, and exchange stars and followers easily.  
Many developers create repositories with great potential but struggle to gain recognition or find collaborators.  
Our mission is to solve these challenges in an ethical, collaborative, and friendly way.

## 🚀 How to Join
1. **Follow the organization** on GitHub: [CollabStars](https://github.com/CollabStars)  
2. **Join our Discord community** to connect with developers, find collaborators, and share projects.  
3. **Contribute to projects**: submit PRs, star repos, or help others improve their work.  

# ⚙️ Setup Script

To help contributors get started quickly with the CollabStars project, we provide a setup script written in Bash.

This script will:

- Clone the repository if it doesn't exist locally.
- Pull the latest changes if the repo is already cloned.
- Enter the project directory.
- Create and switch to a new branch called `minha-feature` (you can rename this branch as needed).

## 🛠 How to use

1. Make sure you have `git` and `bash` installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. Run the setup script from the project root:

```bash
./collabstars-setup.sh
